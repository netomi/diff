/**
 * This class gathers all the {@link EditCommand commands} needed to transform
 * one objects sequence into another objects sequence.
 * <p>
 * An edit script is the most general view of the differences between two
 * sequences. It is built as the result of the comparison between two sequences
 * by the {@link MyersDiffAlgorithm SequencesComparator} class. The user can
 * walk through it using the <em>visitor</em> design pattern.
 * <p>
 * It is guaranteed that the objects embedded in the {@link InsertCommand insert
 * commands} come from the second sequence and that the objects embedded in
 * either the {@link DeleteCommand delete commands} or {@link KeepCommand keep
 * commands} come from the first sequence. This can be important if subclassing
 * is used for some elements in the first sequence and the <code>equals</code>
 * method is specialized.
